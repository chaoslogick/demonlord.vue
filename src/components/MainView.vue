    <p>Hi, I'm Michael and I'm a front-end developer with a graphic design background.
      I am self-taught and the web in the 90s was my playground.</p>
    <p>For over a decade i've worked with web design and development agencies in a variety
      of industries, with brands such as Kraft, IBM, Wilson, Abbott, and others.</p>
    <p>My primary focus in most of these roles has been tasks like page templating,
      converting design comps into HTML/CSS/JS, and application UI, however I've
      become a swiss army knife of sorts, with skills ranging from logo design
      to HTML email development to single page apps.</p>
    <p>Some other things I enjoy are drawing and painting, practicing classical and
      electric guitar, Dungeons and Dragons, Magic: The Gathering, reading sci-fi and fantasy,
      and the list goes on. I also enjoy lists.</p>
    <p>Please feel free to reach out and chat.</p>
