    <p>Hi, I'm Michael and I'm, ostensibly, a "web developer" with a graphic design background.
      Not sure this encapsulates how I imagine myself to be, but it's how I present myself in
      my professional life.</p>
    <p>Some other things I enjoy are drawing and painting, practicing classical and
      electric guitar, Dungeons and Dragons, Magic: The Gathering, reading sci-fi and fantasy,
      and the list goes on. I also enjoy lists.</p>
    <p>Please feel free to reach out and chat.</p>
