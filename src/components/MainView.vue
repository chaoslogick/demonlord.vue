    <p>Hi, I'm Michael and I am, ostensibly, a `web developer with a graphic design background.`
      Not sure this encapsulates how I imagine myself to be, but it's how I present myself in
      my professional life. Riveting.</p>
    <p>Some other things I enjoy are drawing and painting, practicing classical and
      electric guitar, synthesizers, Dungeons and Dragons, Magic: The Gathering, sci-fi and fantasy,
      etc etc etc. I also enjoy lists.</p>
    <p>Please feel free to chat.</p>
