    <p>hi, i'm michael and i'm a web developer with a graphic design background.</p>
    <p>for over a decade i've worked with web design and development agencies in a variety of industries, with brands such as Kraft, IBM, Wilson, Abbott, and many others.</p>
    <p>my primary focus in most of these roles has been tasks like page templating, converting design comps into live pages with [insert web tech here], and application UI, however i've become a swiss army knife of sorts, with skills ranging from logo design to site wire frames to HTML email development to single page apps.</p>
    <p>please feel free to reach out and chat.</p>
