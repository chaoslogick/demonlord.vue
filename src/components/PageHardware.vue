    <h1>Hardware</h1>
    <p>Computers and audio hardware have been a very important part of my life since I was a teen
      and I never really grew out of any of it. So here is a bing dumb list all the stuff i use
      and life on a regular or semi-regular basis. I will try to include things like configs and other
      hardware specific info that I think is relevant.</p>
