      <h1>Code</h1>
      <p>I am not a great computer programmer, but I enjoy the work I do. Honestly, I spend
        more time thinking about what I would make than actually making anything. The upside
        is that I also don't write any bugs!</p>
      <p>My main area of interest at the time of this writing is data generation and randomization.
        Some of this interest was born during my first days of programming in VB3. More recently,
        like many I've become very interested in NES/SNES ROM hack randomizers, such as the
        <a href="#">Final Fantasy Randomizer</a>, the <a href="#">Dragon Warrior Randomizer</a>,
        or the <a href="#">Legend of Zelda Randomizer</a>.</p>
      <p>That being said I haven't actually spent much time writing generators or randomizers, but
        it's fun to think about so I am expressing that here.</p>

      <p>Here are some projects I have started and will hopefully finish someday.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><a href="#">.dotfiles</a> :: These are my personal configuration files.
          You probably shouldn't use them as-is.</li>
        <li><a href="#">project-name</a> :: This is a project I started to generate project names
          on the command line.</li>
        <li><a href="#">snack-vote</a> :: A prototype for a system to vote on what snacks to buy for
          your office. Built with React.</li>
        <li><a href="#">demonlord.vue</a> :: This website, built with Vue. </li>
      </ul>
