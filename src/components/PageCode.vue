      <h1>Code</h1>
      <p>I am not a great computer programmer, but I enjoy the work I do. I spend
        more time thinking about what I would make than actually making anything. The upside
        is that I also don't write many bugs!</p>
      <p>Despite this, for over a decade I've worked with web design and development agencies
        and in a variety of industries, with brands such as Kraft, IBM, Wilson, Abbott, and others.</p>
      <p>My primary focus in most of these roles has been tasks like page templating,
        converting design comps into functional sites, and application UX/UI, however I've
        become a swiss army knife of sorts, with skills ranging from logo design
        to HTML email development to simple single page apps.</p>

      <h2>Repos</h2>
      <p>Here are some projects I have started and will hopefully finish someday.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><a href="#">.dotfiles</a> :: These are my personal configuration files.
          You probably shouldn't use them as-is.</li>
        <li><a href="#">demonlord.vue</a> :: This website, built with Vue. </li>
        <li><a href="#">demonlord-theme-vscode</a> :: My personal VSCode theme.</li>
        <li><a href="#">project-name</a> :: This is a project I started to generate project names
          on the command line.</li>
        <li><a href="#">snack-vote</a> :: A prototype for a system to vote on what snacks to buy for
          your office, built with React.</li>
      </ul>

    <div class="sub-section">
      <h2>Snippets</h2>
      <p>A few of my personal snippets containing some code I like to reuse. I'm not sure how much
        of these I actually wrote anymore.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><a href="#">animation-behaviors.scss</a> :: Some mixins and includes for simple movement.</li>
        <li><a href="#">blackNoise.js</a> :: This can actually be any color but black noise sounds cool.</li>
        <li><a href="#">colorBlast.js</a> :: Furious BG color changer. Please don't look at this if you are epileptic.</li>
        <li><a href="#">userChrome.css</a> :: My Firefox userChrome .css file.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="sub-section">
      <h2>Shell Scripts</h2>
      <p>Not sure why these aren't just gists? I wanted a new section.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><a href="#">github-cloneall.sh</a> :: Shell script with some Ruby to clone all of a user's github repos.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
