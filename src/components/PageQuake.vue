      <h1>Quake</h1>
      <p>In 1996, id Software released a ground breaking first person shooter game called <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quake_(video_game)" target="_blank">Quake</a>. I've been playing it since those days, but recently I discovered an artistic joy in creating maps for Quake.</p>
      <p>Here I'll discuss some of my thought process, necessary tools and share some screen shots of the first playable map I created. It was a fun process and serves as a very interesting artistic medium.</p>
